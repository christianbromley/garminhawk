# garminhawk


__garminhawk__ is my first attempt at creating an R package. The Garmin Connect app, whilst comprehensive, allows somewhat limited visualisations of running and cycling data with little space for customisation, and little in the way of depth. 

This package is currently under development, and I am seeking new ways to analyse the data, and new ways to visualise the data all of the time. I will continue to add new functionality to the package as I continue analysing and continue running. As I begin to train for a marathon, this more advanced analysis will become crucial.

At the minute the package consists of quite __basic data visualisation__. My aim to develop __new metrics__ from the data to give improved insights.

I am also yet to robustly test any of the functions. To do this I will need external datasets, and for others to give it a try and feedback.

Please contact me if you have any comments about the code. I am a beginner.
